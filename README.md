# Shortly - The app that shortens any Valid URL's

An app that consumes the [shrtcode API](htts://app.shrtoco.de/) to allows users to enter in any url and have it shortened.

Users are able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on the device being used (responsive)
- Shorten any valid URL
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the input field is empty

---

## Setup

- install Node JS
- npm install
- npm run build
- npm serve -s build

---
###TODOS:
- Copy to clipboard
- change state of copied btn 

--- 
### Things to note
The API takes a long time to respond 
- would be good to add a loading animation
